# Veridose â€“ Tamper-Proof Clinical Trial Management

Veridose is a blockchain-powered platform designed to bring transparency, traceability, and fairness to Phase 3 clinical drug trials. By combining the power of AI and Ethereum, we ensure that patient data, hospital reports, and regulatory actions remain verifiable, unmanipulated, and securely accessible.

## ðŸš¨ The Problem

In Phase 3 of drug trials, pharmaceutical companies collaborate with hospitals to test new drugs on real patients. However:

- *Data can be manipulated* by pharma companies to fast-track approvals.
- *Hospitals may face pressure* or bribery to approve drugs with incomplete or misleading trial results.
- *Regulators struggle* to verify trial authenticity due to lack of transparency.

## ðŸ’¡ Our Solution

Veridose provides a role-based platform for Manufacturers, Hospitals, and Regulators:

- *Manufacturers* can create drug trials and invite hospitals.
- *Hospitals* can accept trials, submit multiple patient reports, and generate a final report.
- *Regulators* can view all trial data, verify reports, and review AI-generated analysis.

Each critical step is:
- *Stored on MongoDB* for structured access,
- *Analyzed by AI* to detect abnormalities,
- *Hashed and stored on Ethereum* to ensure audit-proof records.
